# Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems Repository

Welcome to the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems repository! This collection of Jupyter notebooks is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of RAG systems, with a focus on practical applications and theoretical insights.

## Overview

RAG systems are a powerful approach to leveraging knowledge graphs for enhanced data retrieval and generation tasks. This repository aims to equip you with the necessary skills to work with RAG systems by providing a series of tutorials and examples that cover various aspects of graph querying and manipulation.

## Contents

- **cypher.ipynb**: The first notebook in this series introduces you to Neo4j, a leading graph database, and the Cypher Query Language. You'll learn how to query and manipulate knowledge graphs effectively, with practical examples and best practices.

- **Future Notebooks**: As the repository grows, additional notebooks will be added to cover other aspects of RAG systems, including advanced querying techniques, integration with machine learning models, and more.

- **Hands-on Exercises**: Each notebook includes interactive exercises to help you practice and solidify your understanding of the concepts covered.
